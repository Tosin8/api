Title: API Management (An Architect's guide to developing and managing APIs)

Chapter 1: Introdution to APIs 

What is API? Application Programming Interface. 
 * An API is a software to software Interface that defines the contract for Applications to talk to each other over a network without user Interaction. 
 * API can be thought of as windows to the code base - they clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software application, saving time and resources and avoiding any potential  legal entanglements along the way. 
 * The contract defines the protocol, the input and output formats and the underlying data types to be used for the software components to interact. 

APIs are different from Web Sites
 * Websites publish information that can be consumed by a user, but don't have contracts ( the layout, content and the look and feel can change without prior notice to the users). API - has a well defined contracts, other applications depend on this to use it. If the contract changes , there will be a ripple effect on the apps built using the contract, changes could be in the business logic, or the back-end infrastructure or the interface defining the API contract.
